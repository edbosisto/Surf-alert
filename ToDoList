Program goals:

The intention of the program is to get an email or message alert when the swell and conditions at Nazare (or custom location?) will be incredible.

Check the forecast for surf locations using surf-forecast.com - 12 day forecast
Run program, receive an alert if swell will be above a certain size. Maybe account for rating as well?

- program is run once per day on pythonanywhere
- check forecast to determine whether an email notification is sent.
- email to contain:
    - Note saying big swell is expected (wave height over 6m)
    - Link to forecast page for Nazare
