# Surf-alert

### A simple python application which checks wave height from surf-forecast.com for Nazare and sends an email alert to a personal email address if the wave height is above 6m.
- The app was created to quickly check the 12 day forecast for Nazare, Portugal, because I've always wanted to see it absolutely pumping but I need a bit of notice to get there!
- Requests, Beautiful Soup 4 and smtplib modules used to scrape the forecasting site and send a simple email notification.
